This directory contains live config files for real instances, usually
with a .$HOSTNAME suffix.  These are not intended for being used in
the piuparts Debian packages (or only in /usr/share/doc/.../examples/).
The update-piuparts-(master|slave)-setup scripts (run by piuparts(s|m)) use
them when running and updating an instance directly from GIT.
General config files are placed in ../conf/
