Packages that leave obsolete conffiles after upgrade.
Using <pre>dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile</pre> via dh_installdeb package.maintscript files is the recommended way to clean them up.
There may be false positives, e.g. if a conffile was converted to a maintainer script managed configuration file.
