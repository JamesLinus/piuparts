piuparts (0.38) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New default behaviours in piuparts:
   * --skip-minimize is now the default. This is because debootstrap is called
     with --variant=minbase instead of --resolv-deps now and because if a 
     base.tgz or an lvm snapshot is specified, piuparts should not touch it.
   * Add two new options: --keyring to specify the keyring to use with
     debootstrap (defaults to /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg)
     and --do-not-verify-signatures to not use --keyring with debootstrap.
     In the chroots, APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated is set accordingly in
     /etc/apt/apt.conf.

piuparts (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * piuparts 0.36 introduces many changes to master-slave mode, please read
    debian/changelog carefully.
  * Backwards compatibility of the configuration files for master-slave-mode 
    has been broken, as the three config files got merged into one: 
    /etc/piuparts/piuparts.conf
  * piuparts-reports has been re-added and improved.
  * The documentation files have been merged and converted to asciidoc.
