piuparts (0.38) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * --skip-minimize is now the default. This is because debootstrap is called
    with --variant=minbase instead of --resolv-deps now and because if a 
    base.tgz or an lvm snapshot is specified, piuparts should not touch it.

piuparts (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * piuparts 0.36 introduces many changes to master-slave mode, please read
    debian/changelog carefully.
  * Backwards compatibility of the configuration files for master-slave-mode 
    has been broken, as the three config files got merged into one: 
    /etc/piuparts/piuparts.conf
  * piuparts-reports has been re-added and improved.
  * The documentation files have been merged and converted to asciidoc.
