This is piuparts, packaged for Debian by Lars Wirzenius <liw@iki.fi>.
Original author is also Lars Wirzenius.

Upstream source repository: http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=piuparts/piuparts.git
Upstream is bunch of lunatics who don't make release tarballs publicly
available. The Debian .orig.tar.gz is what would be released, though.
