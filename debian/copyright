 Upstream is bunch of lunatics who don't make release tarballs publicly
 available. The Debian .orig.tar.gz is what would be released, though.

 In the preparation of the 0.8.90 release Novell took care of tracking
 down all the contributors to get them to relicense their artwork
 into Public Domain.
 .
 The COPYING file of the tarball states the following:
 | The icons in this repository are herefore released into the Public Domain.
 .
 Additionally the copyright status of the files was tracked in the CVS and the
 rdf properties of the SVGs adjusted for all files that were put into Public
 Domain (see rdf:about and rdf:resource).  Both fields contain a link to the
 Creative Commons Public Domain Dediciation[0] as reproduced below:

 | hereby dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work
 | of authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A

 | Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment

 | such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all
 | rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
 | Work.
