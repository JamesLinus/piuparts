ENVIRONMENT
-----------

BUGS
----
*piuparts_slave_run* should be able to run slaves in different ways:
1. all, in a new screen (only this is implemented at the moment)
2. a specific one, in a specified screen slot in a (running) screen
3. append one to a (running) screen using a "random" slot
4. start slave in the current directory in the current shell in foreground.
