Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package fails to upgrade from
'lenny' to 'squeeze' to 'wheezy' to 'jessie'.
It installed fine in 'lenny', and upgraded to 'squeeze' and 'wheezy'
successfully, but then the upgrade to 'jessie' failed.

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


cheers,
