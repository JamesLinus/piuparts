This is piuparts, packaged for Debian by Lars Wirzenius <liw@iki.fi>.
Original author is also Lars Wirzenius.

Upstream source repository: http://liw.iki.fi/liw/bzr/
Upstream is a lunatic who doesn't make release tarballs publically
available. The Debian .orig.tar.gz is what would be released, though.

piuparts is free software.  You may copy it according to the
GNU General Public License, version 2. A copy of the license
is not included, but you can get one from most FTP sites that
have GNU software, for example, prep.ai.mit.edu.

On a Debian GNU/Linux system, the GPL version 2 can be found in
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 (and if that file does not exist,
then /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL should contain it).
