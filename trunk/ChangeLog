        * Further detailed changes to be seen in the bzr commit message
          log, and summarized in the NEWS file for each release.

2005-10-17  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Version 0.12.
        
        * /var/log/faillog ignored by default.
        
        * Documented that upgrade testing to experimental doesn't work.

2005-10-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Version 0.11.
        
        * Summary of changes:
        
            - Checks for missing package names on command line immediately,
              not after creating chroot.
              
            - apt-get in the chroot gets configured to allow unauthenticated
              repositories.
              
            - Tweaks to list of files ignored by default.

2005-09-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Version 0.10.

2005-09-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: When creating policy-rc.d, make it executable.
        
        * piuparts.docbook: Added missing "if". Thanks, Jonas Meurer.
        
        * run-piuparts.py: Wrote.

2005-09-09  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Version 0.9.

2005-09-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Added --resolv-deps to debootstrap call, so that it
        works with testing/sid.

2005-09-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py, piuparts.docbook: Added -k (--keep-tmpdir) option.

	* piuparts.py: Added some more default ignores.

	* piuparts.py: Remember which packages own which files before
	removing packages.

2005-08-31  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Made panic() work. Added feature to report which
        packages own the new/modifed/removed files. Requested in Debian
        bug 324248 by Anibal Monsalve Salazar.

2005-08-30  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Use Python 2.3's logging module instead of NIH
        code. Also, log everything identically to stdout and log file,
        since the old behavior was confusing to many people, as observed
        on IRC and at Debconf5. This also obsoletes -v (--verbose).
        
        * piuparts.docbook: Document that -v (--verbose) is obsolete.

2005-08-30  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.docbook: It's <envar>, not <envvar>, and you need to
        pay attention to warning messages, you imbecile.

2005-08-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Version 0.8.

2005-08-29  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Accept matches for any part of a filename, instead
        of requiring that they match everything. This is less surprising
        to users and they can still use ^ and $ to anchor a match to the
        ends, if they need it.
        
        * Makefile: Ignore the fdmount temp files that cause upgrades to
        etch/sid fail at the moments, and re-enable upgrade tests.
        
        * piuparts.py, piuparts.docbook: Added option -t and changed the
        default location for temporary files and directorys (including
        the chroot) to be $TMPDIR (or /tmp if not set).

2005-08-25  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Makefile: Upgrade testing from sarge to etch fails for me, because
        of something to do with fdutils, so I have disabled it for now.
        
        * piuparts.py: Only use the first mirror found in sources.list,
        which is anyway what the manual page claims we are doing. This
        should reduce the problems people have been having with piuparts
        creating broken source.lists in the chroot when people have more
        than a canonical Debian repository listed.
        
        * piuparts.py: Remove temporary files upon error exit.
        
        * piuparts.docbook: Use code names instead of
        stable/testing/unstable in the example.

2005-07-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Version 0.7.

2005-07-15  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Makefile: Moved binary to sbin since only root can usefully
        run it.

2005-07-13  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Create a /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d inside the chroot
        when it is created. Suggested by Frank Lichtenheld.
        
        * piuparts.py: Fixed a message from "FAIL:" to "PASS:". Oops.
        
        * Makefile: Commented out an explicit mirror definition so it
        should now use sources.list defaults.

2005-07-10  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Suggested by Frank Lichtenheld: don't run dpkg
        and do other work if there are no files (cleans up log file,
        saves a couple of seconds).
        
        * piuparts.py, piuparts.docbook: Implemented and documented a
        limit on the size of outputs of command piuparts runs.

2005-07-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: When a command has been run and it failed, show
        the output it gave. Removed extra dashes from argument to
        getopt. Changed references to "dit" (the old name for the
        program) to "piuparts". Changed some log file lines a bit easier
        to grep for, and made the start of a log easier to see. Bugs
        reported and wishes expressed by Frank Lichtenheld.

2005-07-08  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.docbook: Added notes that piuparts needs to be run as
        root and that options must come before other command line
        arguments.

2005-07-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Version 0.6.

2005-07-05  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Bugfix: when removing packages from the chroot,
	don't remove packages being depended on before the packages doing
	the depending. That won't work. Any fool would know it, except me.
	
	* piuparts.py: Implemented saving of meta data for the upgrade
	testing between Debian releases.

2005-07-04  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Made it possible to specify components to use for
	a mirror.
	
	* piuparts.docbook: Documented the user visible changes.

2005-06-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Remove and purge dependencies before the packages
	that were installed, so that problems with postrm scripts using
	non-essential packages upon purge become evident.

2005-06-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py, piuparts.docbook: Added -n / --no-ignores option.

2005-06-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Made mirrors mentioned in /etc/apt/sources.list be
	the default mirrors. Also, --mirror can be used multiple times
	now.
	
	* piuparts.docbook: Documented this.
	
	* Makefile: log to tmp3.log instead of twice to tmp2.log.

2005-06-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Makefile: Use -f with gzip so it doesn't complain when installing
	new version on top of old.

2005-06-27  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Added /etc/ld.so.conf to list of ignored files
	and changed exim related ignore patterns (adding exim4, for
	example).
	
        * piuparts.py: When purging, use --purge and not --remove to
        dpkg.
	
        * piuparts.py: Report version and command line arguments at
        startup.
        
        * piuparts.py: When calling install_purge_test, report package
        list when command line args are package names, instead of empty
        list.

2005-06-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Version 0.5.

2005-06-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Check symlink targets as well.

2005-06-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.docbook: Added --ignore-regexp to manual page.

2005-06-23  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* TODO: Added.
	
	* Makefile: Added test case for upgrading between distros.
	
	* piuparts.docbook: Rewrote DESCRIPTION and EXAMPLES sections.
	
	* piuparts.py: Added /var/cache/man/index.db and
	/var/log/dpkg.log to ignored files. Added regexps for more
	versatile ignoring and -I option.
	
	* piuparts.py: Disabled comparison of mtimes of files for now.
	
	* piuparts.py: File listings are now sorted.
	
	* piuparts.py: Added upgrade tests between Debian releases.

2005-06-20  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Refactored things more than a bit in preparation
	for new functionality.

2005-06-19  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Version 0.4.

2005-06-19  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.docbook, piuparts.py: Added -p option.
	
	* piuparts.docbook: Updated a description of what the program
	does.

2005-06-19  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.docbook: Documented upgrade testing.

2005-06-19  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Added a simple form of upgrade testing.

2005-06-19  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Implemented suggestion from Frank Lichtenheld to
        do package purginging in two steps: first remove, then purge.
        This helps find postrm scripts that use things they aren't
        allowed to use.
	
	* README: Added naming credit to Tollef Fog Heen.

2005-06-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* Version 0.3.

2005-06-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * piuparts.py: Added /var/cache/debconf and
        /var/cache/debconf/passwords.dat to the list of filenames that
        are automatically ignored.
        
        * piuparts.py: After unpacking a base tarball, run apt-get update
        and clean on it, to be sure everything is up to date.

2005-06-18  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py: Added option -a (--apt) that lets the user install
	the packages to be tested via apt-get, instead of by specifying
	package files.
	
	* piuparts.docbook: Documented -a (--apt).

2005-06-17  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.docbook: Added a note that piuparts is meant for people
	making Debian packages before they upload them.

2005-06-17  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py, piuparts.docbook: Added -V (--version) option.

2005-06-17  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

	* piuparts.py, README: Removed notice about python-apt / apt_pkg
	since it wasn't actually used.
	
        * piuparts.py: Changed things so that we us os.walk and os.stat
        to find filesystem object meta data, instead of creating a
        tarball and then scanning that. This makes things quite a bit
        faster: with a pre-generate base tarball (from pbuilder, for
        example), a simple installation test can now happen in less than
        7 seconds wall clock time.

2005-06-14  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@iki.fi>

        * Version 0.2.

        * Second public release. The first one was just a mention on an
        IRC channel, so it doesn't really count, and I didn't feel like
        doing change log entries before now. This version only does
        simple installation and removal testing, but should work at
        least for simple cases.
