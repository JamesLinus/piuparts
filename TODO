Things to do for piuparts
=========================

for 0.36:

- report:
 - find_log() is not used atm
 - refactor code, sources.txt should not be calculated where it currently is
 - include links to http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=$maintainer_email
 - include links to logfiles in source summary pages
- slave
 - mention distro when sending logs
 - slave_stop script - unneeded with patch for #523958
- then R
- include patch for #519192
- probably include patch for #523950
- take care of old conf files on upgrades
- take care of old pyc files from python-central
- test pipuparts with piuparts before uploading
- provides are not handled correctly: ie libapt-pkg-perl has a dependency on 
  libapt-pkg-libc6.7-6-4.6 which piuparts believes is an unknown-package while 
  in reality its provided by apt
- break circular dependencies when there are only circular dependencies left for 
  testing. prefer circular dependencies from the same source package until there are
  none of this kind left.
  warn visibly in logfile (but without error) when testing a packages with
  circular dependencies.

for 0.37:

- report: 
 - write stats about the reasons for failures
 - write stats for total number of logs (when a package has more than a log in fail/ or bugged/)
 - RSS feeds of logs

- expire old logs a month after sucessful testing

- create emacspeak-broken-dpkg-preconfigure package for broken repo. (then later
  put more broken packages in there and use that for testing piuparts)

- monitor:
 - write slave-watcher to monitor hanging processes, eg. looping dpkg-preconfigure
 - Check for and kill extraneous processes afterwards. Perhaps by checking
   whether their working directory is in the chroot.
   Introduce a whitelist of processes to wait for and assume it's an error 
   if those haven't been killed after $time=10min. see #387428
 - master.log grows to fast and there is no mechanism to stop it

- piuparts-slave: if chroot.tgz is older than N hours, regenerate it

- slave_run: cleanup stale proc mountpoints

- split the failed state into several problem-type failed states

- the templates used by update-reports.py should be taken from /etc/piuparts/templates/
  and not be included in the python source

- write reportbug wrapper for mass bug filing (start simple, make it more sophisticated 
  in 0.38)

- publish FAI classes to setup piuparts.$fqdn automatically

for 0.38 and on:

- multi-arch:
 - piuparts-report should have a list of available arch and list packages 
   only available on untested archs in a new state "(depends-)not-available-on-tested-archs"
 - master should (per default) only schedule packages which are not available 
   on the master arch to slaves of different archs -> "schedule-evenly-to-slaves = no"

- piuparts can't currently test upgrades of required packages. (Because they
  cannot be removed, it assumes these are untestable, which is only true for
  removal tests...

- find_default_debian_mirrors: if parts[2] contains a / (think
  stable/updates for security.d.o), you can't ignore this, it will break
  later...

- support for extra-packages-url (for volatile, security, etc)

- not sure if it's a sensible thing to to, but provide a way to turn of debugging
  output for piuparts.py

- piuparts can't currently test postfix, since installing postfix removes
  exim and removing postfix would require re-installing exim, and that
  doesn't happen; there's other packages like that, too

- mounting /proc and perhaps others (usbfs, sysfs, /dev/pts, etc.) in
  the chroot might be a good idea because some packages might need this.
  Interestingly enough this currently seems to prevent start-stop-daemon
  from starting any daemons ;)

Low priority stuff (a.k.a. "nobody's said they must have it now")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* move shell cronjobs functionality into master, slave & report

* make it possible to call aptitude (or similar) instead of apt-get and 
  allow to override the commandline arguments of the used program (to be 
  able to test with and without recommended packages or authentication).

* Kill children after a timeout to make sure the test doesn't run forever.

* include a test to see which packages which modify their own conffiles 
  so the user is presented with a dpkg conffile changed dialogue during
  the upgrade.  It would also be very interesting to see how many packages
  leave behind orphaned conffiles after purging a newer version which does
  not contain the files anymore.

* Bill Allombert: Does piupart test whether packages trigger useless
  conffiles handling ? (i.e. dpkg pretend you have modified a conffile
  when it has not) this is one kind of bugs I would really get rid of.
  h01ger: #466118 sounds like it does.

* deal with packages that need to replace higher priority packages
  (which then need to be put back when the package is removed)

* piuparts-slave: keep track of reservations permanently
* piuparts-master: keep track of whom a reservation is made
* piuparts-slave: timestamps to log messages
* piuparts-slave: make the chroot more minimial
* piuparts: upgrade the chroot before taking a snapshot of its files
