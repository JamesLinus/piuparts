ahings to do for piuparts
=========================

Please also check the BTS, especially the bugs with a severity
higher than wishlist!

for 0.45:

- do not upload with sunny.png weather-severe-alert.png included. Replace them
  with links and add depends to tango-icon-theme. Update copyright.

- test installation via packages only.


for 0.46:

- slave.postinst should setup ~piupartss/.ssh/known_hosts from /etc/ssh,
  even if only for localhost 
- slave.postinst should setup ~piupartsm/.ssh/authorized_keys using triggers
    dpkg-trigger piuparts-master-please-install-the-slave-key

- piuparts-master package fails install, remove, install.

- split /etc/piuparts/piuparts.conf in /etc/piuparts/master.conf and 
  /etc/piuparts/slave.conf?! or use /etc/default/slave to define sections?

- conf/piuparts.sudoers should be split for master+slave packages.

- merge/cleanup README_piatti.txt and README_server.txt?

- use cdn.debian.net as mirror default (instead of "your.mirror.here") and provide
  a debconf template to overwrite this.

- in maintainer view: sort buggy states up again

- more stats and graphs:
  - packages processed per day (in total and per slave)
  - # of open bugs with tag piuparts
  - generate http://piuparts.debian.org/stable/states.png + testing.png
    from existing data

- piuparts-report.py: fix another FIXME in main()

- sometimes a chroot doesn't get removed on piatti - find out
  why and fix it.
- slave_run: cleanup stale proc mountpoints
  -> there is ~piupartss/bin/slave_cleanup now, maybe it should be executed
  at the beginning of slave_run?

- copy/move .kpr files to htdocs?

- piuparts-slave should do the rescheduling of old logs and do so with
  lowest precedence, that is, only when there are no new logs to be tested.

- write reportbug(-like) wrapper for mass bug filing (start
  simple, make it more sophisticated later).

- generate piuparts.1.txt automatically from piuparts.py - see
  this blog post for a nice howto:
  http://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/creating-a-man-page-with-distutils-and-optparse/

- remove the git repository piatti.git.


for 0.47:

- find_default_debian_mirrors: if parts[2] contains a / (think
  stable/updates for security.d.o), you can't ignore this, it
  will break later...

- support for extra-packages-url (for backports, security, etc)

- make it possible to call aptitude (or similar) instead of
  apt-get and allow to override the commandline arguments of the
  used program (to be able to test with and without recommended
  packages or authentication).

- piuparts-slave: timestamps to log messages

- the templates used by update-reports.py should be taken from
  /etc/piuparts/templates/ and not be included in the python
  source


for 0.48 and later:

- mounting /proc and perhaps others (usbfs, sysfs, /dev/pts,
  etc.) in the chroot might be a good idea because some packages
  might need this.

- report:
  - write stats about the reasons for failures, as its done with
    shell scripts now (piuparts-analyze.py is an existing
    "fragment".)
  - RSS feeds of logs
  - do more fancy R graphs, eg. also per state
  - sort packages on maintainer pages alphabetically (states first
    though)
  - link (and target) to piuparts.d.o configuration is static to
    piatti. should refer to the actual hosts configuration, eg
    goldwassers

- a redirect of http://piuparts.d.o/foo to
  http://p.d.o/source/f/foo.html would be nice

- monitor: master.log grows to fast and there is no mechanism to stop it
  - use logrotate


for 0.50 and later:

- really support multiple architectures:
  - piuparts-report should have a list of available arch and list
    packages only available on untested archs in a new state
    "(depends-)not-available-on-tested-archs"
  - master should (per default) only schedule packages which are
    not available on the master arch to slaves of different archs
  -> "schedule-evenly-to-slaves = no"

- piuparts-master: keep track of to whom a reservation was given

- piuparts can't currently test upgrades of required packages.
  (Because they cannot be removed, it assumes these are
  untestable, which is only true for removal tests...

- not sure if it's a sensible thing to to, but provide a way to
  turn off debugging output for piuparts.py - see
  http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html

- commandline-switches for all programms

- move shell cronjobs functionality into master, slave & report


1.0 should really have automated testing of piuparts itself...
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- create archive of broken packages to provide test cases for
  piuparts testing.

- create emacspeak-broken-dpkg-preconfigure package for broken
  repo. (then later put more broken packages in there and use
  that for testing piuparts)
