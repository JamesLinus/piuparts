#
# Omitted fields will be set to defaults and completely "missing"
# [distribution] entries will automatically be generated as follows:
#
# [<distribution>]
# uri = <default mirror>
# distribution = <distribution>
# components = <default components>
# depends =
# target-release =
#
# These are the standard fields for sources.list entries:
#   uri, distribution, components
#
# A non-empty "target-release" will add a -t argument to apt-get:
#   apt-get -t <target-release> ...
#
# The "depends" entry can be used to refer to the "parent distribution"
# (e.g. stable) of a "partial distribution" (e.g. stable-backports).
