Subject: : fails to upgrade from 'testing' - trying to overwrite ...

Package:
Version:
Severity: serious

Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package fails to upgrade from
'testing'. It installed fine in 'testing', then the upgrade to 'sid'
fails because it tries to overwrite other packages files without
declaring a replaces relation.

See policy 7.6 at
http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-replaces

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


cheers,
