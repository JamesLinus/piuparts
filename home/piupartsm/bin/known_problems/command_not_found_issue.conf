HELPTEXT="Packages which passed the piuparts test but have logs with the string 'command not found' in them.

Failures due to #530501 (/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssh-client.postrm: line 34: delgroup: command not found) have been ignored.

From the third paragraph about the meaning of the depends field in http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

The Depends field should also be used if the postinst, prerm or postrm scripts require the package to be present in order to run. __Note, however, that the postrm cannot rely on any non-essential packages to be present during the purge phase__.

Please file bugs!"
