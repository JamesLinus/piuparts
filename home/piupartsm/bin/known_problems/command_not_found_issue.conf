HEADER='Packages which passed the piuparts test but have logs with the string "command not found"'
HELPTEXT='
<p>Failures due to #530501 (/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssh-client.postrm: line 34: delgroup: command not found) have been ignored.</p>

<p>From the third paragraph about the meaning of the depends field in 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps</a>:
</p>

<pre>
The Depends field should also be used if the postinst, prerm or postrm scripts
require the package to be present in order to run. __Note, however, that the
postrm cannot rely on any non-essential packages to be present during the
purge phase__.
