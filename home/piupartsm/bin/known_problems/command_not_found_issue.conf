<p>From the third paragraph about the meaning of the depends field in 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps</a>:
</p>

<pre>
The Depends field should also be used if the postinst, prerm or postrm scripts
require the package to be present in order to run. __Note, however, that the
postrm cannot rely on any non-essential packages to be present during the
purge phase__.
