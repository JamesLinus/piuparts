HELPTEXT="Packages with failed logs because there were processes running inside the chroot at the end of the piuparts run.

This is probably due to directly calling /etc/rc.d/ scripts in packages maintainer scripts, which is a violation of policy 9.3.3.2 and must be replaced by using policy-rc.d - see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.3.3

Please file bugs!"
