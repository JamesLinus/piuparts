HELPTEXT='
<p>
The piuparts logfile for these packages contains the string <pre>E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes</pre>, which is usually an indication, that an essential package needs to be removed to install this package. As piuparts does not use that much force, the piuparts test fails.
</p>
<p>
This is usually not an error in the package and it needs to be seen how piuparts should deal with it.
